# Flutter Resources: A Beyond the Basics Guide

This is a list of resources for learning Flutter beyond the basics. It includes books, videos, and other resources that will help you take your Flutter skills to the next level. _[Inspired by Flutter Roadmap by @olexale](https://github.com/capps096github/flutter_roadmap)_

## Introduction

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform (mobile, web, desktop, and embedded) applications from a single codebase.

Flutter is powered by Dart, a language optimized for fast apps on any platform.
(mobile, web, desktop, and embedded)

## Getting Started

1. (Optional) Learn Dart Programming Language first, if you are really totally new to programming. But if you know any programming language, like Java, Kotlin, you can skip this step.

    - [Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev/guides)
    - [Learn Dart Intro](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/bootstrap-into-dart)
    - Take the [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/language) to2 get a quick overview of Dart if you are already familiar with programming.
